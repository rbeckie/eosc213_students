Lesson overview
===============

In this lesson we will learn how to create and use *functions*, one of the most powerful concepts in programming.
We will also introduce you to the concept of a *module* (also known as a library in other programming languages), which you can think of as a toolbox for a specific purpose.
Each module contains specific functionalities (i.e., functions) that you can use for different tasks.
Thus functions and modules are closely related.
