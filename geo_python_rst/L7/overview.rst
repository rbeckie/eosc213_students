Lesson overview
===============

During this week, we will introduce you to data visualization and some different modules that can be used to make data plots in Python.
You can create simple plots directly from `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__, but in order to control many aspects of those plots we need to also know how to use the module hidden within plotting in Pandas called `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__.
Matplotlib is an extremely powerful and flexible plotting module, and as you will see, there are many excellent example plots available online to help you get started.
