Hints for Exercise 7
====================

Converting a column of date-strings into datetime format
--------------------------------------------------------

In some cases Pandas cannot understand and parse automatically the date information from a column when you read the
data with ``read_csv()`` function. In these cases, you need to parse the date information afterwards.

Let's see an example with following data

.. code::

    DATE, Value
    "201401", 1
    "201402", 2
    "201403", 3
    "201404", 5

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

        import os
        import pandas as pd
        fp = os.path.join(os.path.abspath('data'), 'L7', "hintData.txt")

Let's try to read the data and parse the date.

.. ipython:: python

    data = pd.read_csv(fp, sep=',', parse_dates=['DATE'])
    data.head()
    data.dtypes

As we can see from above, Pandas was not able to convert the datatype of ``DATE`` into ``datetime`` format.
This is because the DATE values does not include information about the day of the year but only the year and month.

There is a way to tell to Pandas to read the ``DATE`` information with a custom format such as the one we have here
with ``pd.to_timestamp()`` function where we can specify with ``format`` parameter the custom format how the dates
are represented in the data. Consider following example:

.. ipython:: python

    data['datetime'] =  pd.to_datetime(data['DATE'], format='%Y%m')
    data.head()
    data.dtypes

Great, now we have the data in ``datetime`` format!

Creating an empty DataFrame with a datetime index
-------------------------------------------------

For Problem 2 in this exercise you are asked to calculate average seasonal ages for each year in our data file.
The easiest way to do this is to create an empty DataFrame to store the seaonal temperatures, with one temperature for each year and season.
Thus, the DataFrame should have columns for each season and the date as an index.
In order to do this, we'll need first to create a variable to store the dates for the index, then create the DataFrame using that index.
Let's consider an example for my world, where there are two seasons: ``coldSeason`` and ``warmSeason``.
For each season, I want list the number of times I wore a jacket, with data from the past 4 years.
I can start by making a variable with 1 date for each of the past 4 years using the Pandas ``pd.date_range()`` function.

.. ipython:: python

    timeIndex = pd.date_range('2014', '2017', freq='AS')
    print(timeIndex)

As you can see, we now have a variable ``timeIndex`` in the Pandas datetime format with dates for January 1 of the past 4 years.
The starting and ending years are clear, and the ``freq='AS'`` indicates the frequecy of dates between the listed starting and ending times.
In this case, ``AS`` refers to annual values (1 time per year) at the start of the year.

With the ``timeIndex`` variable, we can now create our empty DataFrame to store the seasonal jacket numbers using the Pandas ``pd.DataFrame()`` function.

.. ipython:: python

    seasonData = pd.DataFrame(index=timeIndex, columns=['coldSeason', 'warmSeason'])
    print(seasonData)

Now we have our empty DataFrame where I can fill in the number of times I needed a jacket in each season using the date index!

Slicing up the seasons
----------------------

The other main task in Problem 2 is to sort values from the different months into seasonal average values.
There are several ways in which this can be done, but one nice way to do it is using a ``for`` loop to loop over each year of data you consider and then fill in the seasonal values for that year.
For each year, you want to identify the slice of dates that correspond to that season, calculate their mean, then store that result in the corresponding location in the new DataFrame created in the previous hint.
For the ``for`` loop itself, it may be easiest to start with the second full year of data (1953), since we do not have temperatures for December of 1951.
If you loop over the years from 1953-2016, you can then easily calculate the seasonal average temperatures for each season.
For the winter, you can use ``year - 1`` to find the temperature for December, assuming ``year`` is your variable for the current year in your ``for`` loop. This approach can be used also in relation to Problem 3 and 4.

In `this week's lesson <https://geo-python.github.io/2017/lessons/L7/pandas-plotting.html#selecting-data-based-on-time-in-pandas>`__ we saw how to select a range of dates, but we did not cover how to take the mean value of the slice and store it.
Because a slice of a DataFrame is still a DataFrame object, we can simply use the ``.mean()`` method to calculate the mean of that slice.

.. code:: python

    meanValue = dataFrame['2016-12':'2017-02']['TEMP'].mean()

This would assign the mean value for the ``TEMP`` field between December 2016 and February 2017 to the variable ``meanValue``.
In terms of storing the output value, we can use the ``DataFrame.loc()`` function.
For example:

.. code:: python

    dataFrame.loc[year, 'coldSeason'] = 5

This would store the value ``5`` in the column ``coldSeason`` at index ``year`` of ``dataFrame``.
That's a tricky sentence, but hopefully the idea is clear :).

Labels and legends
------------------

In the plot for Problem 2 you're asked to include a line legend for each subplot.
To do this, you need to do two things:

1. You need to add a ``label`` value when you create the plot using the ``plt.plot()`` function.
   This is as easy as adding a parameter that say ``label='some text'`` when you call ``plt.plot()``.
2. You'll need to display the line legend, which can be done by calling ``plt.legend()`` for each subplot.

Saving multiple plots into a directory
--------------------------------------

In Problems 3 and 4 the aim is to create 65 individual plots, and save those into your computer.
In these kind of situations, the smartest thing to do is to use a ``for`` loop and at the end of each
loop, save the image into a folder that you have specified. There are some useful tricks related to saving
files and generating good file names automatically.

A good approach when saving multiple files into a folder, is to define a separate variable where you store
only the directory path. Then during every loop you combine this directory path, and the file name together.
This can be done by using a function ``os.path.join()`` which is part of ``os`` built-in Python module.

Consider following example:

.. ipython:: python

    import os
    myfolder = r"C:\MyUserName\Temp_visualizations"
    for i in range(5):
        filename = "My_File_" + str(i) + ".png"
        filepath = os.path.join(myfolder, filename)
        print(filepath)

Here, we created a folder path and a unique filename, and in the end parsed a full filepath that could be
used to save a plot into that location on your computer.

Creating an animation from multiple images
------------------------------------------

In Problems 3 and 4 the aim was to plot multiple images on a predefined folder. An optional task
was to create an animation out of those figures. Animating the figures in Problems 3 and 4 is fairly
straightforward task to do in Python. All you need to do is to install a module called ``imageio`` and
run couple lines of code that I show below.

But, first you need to install ``imageio`` module.

Installing the module can be done by running following command **from the command prompt / terminal** with **admin rights**:

.. code:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge imageio


.. note::

    If everything works fine you should not see any errors coming into the screen. If you receive an error, the most typical
    one is that you did not have **admin rights** when trying to install the module. In such case, you should open command prompt
    with admin rights (Command prompt --> right click --> Run as administrator..)

When you have imageio installed you should be able to import it, in Spyder:

.. ipython:: python

    import imageio

Creating the animation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following commands should produce a nice gif-animation out of your plots. The idea is that you list all the
files from the folder where you saved the plots using ``glob`` function, and then pass that file list into imageio
function called ``imageio.mimsave()``. A following example shows how to do that.

First we list all the files from folder that has ``.png`` file format using ``glob``. The ``*`` wildcard character tells to computer that
the name of the file can be anything (the purpose of the star). ``.png`` after the star tells that the filename should end with ``.png`` characters.
If there are some other files with other file format than .png, they will be excluded.
Finally, we create the animation into the computer.

.. code:: python

    import glob
    import imageio

    # Find all files from given folder that has .png file-format
    search_criteria = r"C:\MyUserName\Temp_visualizations\*.png"

    # Execute the glob function that returns a list of filepaths
    figure_paths = glob.glob(search_criteria)

    # Save the animation to disk with 48 ms durations
    output_gif_path = r"C:\MyUserName\Temp_animation.gif"
    imageio.mimsave(output_gif_path, [imageio.imread(fp) for fp in figure_paths], duration=0.48, subrectangles=True)

With these lines of code you should be able to create a nice animation out of your plots!
