Lesson overview
===============

Today we will have our first taste of programming in Python. In order to start learning
Python, however, we need to introduce you how we will work during the course using different tools including a
dedicated computing environment, which is based on the principles of `cloud
computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing>`__. This first
tutorial will introduce you to the basic components of the course
environment, guide you through how they are used, and conclude with a
hands-on introduction to some key concepts and elements of programming
in Python. The main components of this first lesson are below.

0. :doc:`Lecture materials (+video)<lesson-video>`
1. :doc:`Basic concepts, components and, workflow of the course environment <course-environment-components>`
2. :doc:`Introduction to the basic usage of the cloud computing environment <intro-to-cloud-environment>`
3. :doc:`Communicating and chatting with Slack <slack-usage>`
4. :doc:`Our first taste of Python <A-taste-of-Python>`
5. :doc:`Exercise 1: Creating a Github.com account and using the cloud <exercise-1>`

.. note::

    There is a lot of material here but don't worry, you will learn all these things quickly once we start working in practice.
