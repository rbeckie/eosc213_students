Windows: Connect to remote Computer Instance with Remote Desktop Connection tool
================================================================================

**Remote Desktop Connection** -tool is another remote desktop software that comes with every Windows
computer. It is simple to use but has slightly less smooth user experience when compared to TightVNC. However, it is a good option
since it can be used from any Windows computer (e.g., from the computers in the University's libraries or your own
Windows computer) without any additional software installation.


1. Start the tool by clicking the Windows Start button and searching it
   with word 'Etätyöpöytäyhteys' (or 'Remote Desktop Connection' in
   english)

2. Paste the IP address of your computer instance that you copied in the
   `previous step <intro-to-course-environment.html#copy-the-ip-address-of-your-computer-instance>`__ and press
   ``Yhdistä`` ('Connect' in English)
