Activating Pebbles account
==========================

The first time using the course environment, it is necessary to activate
your Pebbles account and create your password. This needs to be
done only once when the course starts.

.. note::

    If you already have activated your account you can continue with `launching a new computer instance <intro-to-course-environment.html#launch-a-new-computer-instance>`__.

**To activate your account, follow these steps:**

.. admonition:: 1. Follow the activation link that was sent to you by the course lecturer

.. admonition:: 2. Handle insecure connection warning

   This exception will occur only once when you activate your account, hence, you won't see this message again later.

.. admonition:: 3. Create a password for your account (Be sure to remember this, you will need it frequently)
