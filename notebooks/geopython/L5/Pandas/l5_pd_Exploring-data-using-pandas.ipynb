    "# Exploring data using Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task in this week's lesson is to learn how to read and explore data files using Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring the weather data, we will get familiar with Pandas data structures: *Series* and *DataFrame*. **Pandas DataFrame** (a 2-dimensional data structure) is used for storing and mainpulating table-like data (data with rows and columns) in Python. You can think of Pandas DataFrame as an attribute table (an excel-like spreadsheet, but much better!). **Pandas Series** (a 1-dimensional data structure) is used for storing and manipulating an sequence of values. Pandas Series is kind of like a list, but more clever. One row or one column in a Pandas DataFrame is actually a Pandas Series. For a comprehensive overview of pandas data structures, you can have a look at Wes MacKinney's book **Python for Data Analysis (2nd Edition, 2017)** and [Pandas online documentation about data structures](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading data files using Pandas will make life a bit easier compared to the traditional Python way of reading data files. If you're curious about that, you can check out some of the [lesson materials from previous years about reading data \n",
    "in the Pythonic way](https://geo-python.github.io/2018/2017/lessons/L5/reading-data-from-file.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparations for this lesson (working environment and input data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start a jupyter lab instance (using the links at the top of this page) and open this lesson in an interactive mode.\n",
    "2. Have a look at the input data which is a text file containing weather observations from Kumpula\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The data file name is `Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt`\n",
    "    - The file is available in the binder and CSC notebook instances, under L5 folder \n",
    "    - or, you can download the file from [here](https://github.com/geo-python/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/L5/Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt)\n",
    "    - The data file contains observed daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures from June 2016 recorded from the Kumpula weather observation station in Helsinki.\n",
    "    - The data has been derived from a data file of daily temperature measurments downloaded from the [US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information climate database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/).\n",
    "    - There are something like 30 lines of data in the data file.\n",
